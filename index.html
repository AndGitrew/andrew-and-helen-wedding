                  <h1>GAME SUMMARY:</h1>
                  <p>Safety consists of a lineup of players each taking turns adding to the team's points by either making a free throw or jumping and making their own rebound. If, however, a point is not made, then the player must save or 'safety' the game by making a basket from where the ball was caught without violating the bounce or the step rule. The object of the game is to beat a previous high score.</p>
